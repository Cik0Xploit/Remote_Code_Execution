A repository documenting my learning journey about Remote Code Execution vulnerabilities, particularly in PHP environments.

## üìå Overview

Remote Code Execution (RCE) is a critical security vulnerability that allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on a target server. This repository contains my notes, payloads, and mitigation strategies learned while studying RCE vulnerabilities.

## üî• Key Concepts

### What is RCE?
- Allows attackers to execute commands on a remote system
- Often achieved through injection vulnerabilities
- Can lead to complete system compromise
- Commonly rated as Critical severity (CVSS 9.0+)

### Common Attack Vectors:
- Unsanitized user input passed to execution functions
- Insecure file upload handling
- Dangerous deserialization
- Server-side template injection

## üíª Dangerous PHP Functions

These PHP functions can lead to RCE if used improperly with user input:

| Function       | Risk Level | Description |
|----------------|------------|-------------|
| `exec()`       | High       | Executes external program |
| `system()`     | High       | Executes command and displays output |
| `passthru()`   | High       | Executes command and displays raw output |
| `shell_exec()` | High       | Executes command via shell |
| Backticks (`` ` ``) | High | Same as shell_exec() |
| `popen()`      | Medium     | Opens process file pointer |
| `proc_open()`  | Medium     | Advanced process control |
